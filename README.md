# Hello-World
 
 Welcome to my world. 
 I am currently testing out GitHub.
 I will be uploading my analytics projects down the line.
 Plan to add non-proprietary or masked modeling/analytics/strategy/decision support projects.
 Also sample codes in R, Python, Tableau, Bokeh, maybe, even SAS, though I'm weaning from the latter. 
 Still learning about how to upload and share IJupyter notebooks. That's in the plan.
